<h2>Requirements-</h2>
<p>Just the Cyberpunk Red Core System. Everything else you need is contained in this module.</p>
<h2>What's it do?</h2>
<p>The Gunpath is a gun generator. It can quickly produce a firearm, bow, or heavy weapon, weapon quality, attachments, and naming pattern suggestions. From there, you can quickly generate items in the game and populate your Cyberpunk Red or 2077 game with unique weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Notes-</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There is a mild houserule in this generator that includes the odds, between 16-25% depending on the weapon, of not having any attachments, reflecting the "standard" weapons in the world. I may separate this out into a RAW and "standard weapon" generator or adjust the odds of a normal weapon depending on feedback.</li>
    <li>There's a lot of name generator tables in here linked to basically nothing, like I said it's a beta. I haven't decided on trying to create a name generator. Most of them will be garbage unless I curate the lot of them and I don't know if I'll do that. If you're interested in taking that part of the project on, let me know.</li>
    <li>I'm not thrilled with the weapon cost rules and the generator will spit out inappropriate combinations (junk gun manufacturers and excellent quality guns). I put a couple points in about potential house mods to make the weapons more interesting. Let me know if they work for you or not. They don't impact the output of course.</li>
